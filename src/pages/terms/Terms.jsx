              The User pledges not to disclose Confidential Information, protect from and prevent
              unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information, and take appropriate measures

              according to this Agreement, becomes available to a third party without a consent of
              the Copyright Owner, the User agrees to indemnify the Copyright Owner for all suffered
              damages.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Program is provided "AS IS" with all possible malfunction and in the state that is
              actual by the time the Copyright Owner provides the User with the Full License or the
              Additional License.
              <br />
              Under no circumstances the Copyright Owner guarantees error-free and uninterrupted
              performance of the Program and that the Program will meet the requirements of the User
              as well as the Copyright Owner disclaims any other warranties to the extent to which
              it is permitted by the effective law.
            </p>

            <h5 className="mb-2 font-bold mt-4 text-xl">6. Liability</h5>

            <p>
              The User assumes all the risks related to the performance and the Use of the Program,
              including the risk of not getting the expected profit, the risk of a software failure
              after the Program is installed, etc.
              <br />
              Under no circumstances the Copyright Owner is liable to the User for any damages

              Program or impossibility to Use the Program.
              <br />
              In the event that the law of the User's country concedes no limitation of liability,
              or the liability of the Copyright Owner is recognized by the competent court, the
              Copyright Owner will be liable only for actual damage incurred from Using the Program
              if the damage is caused by a tort of the Copyright Owner, or if the damage is caused
              by the reasons that the Copyright Owner knew or should have known. The maximum amount
              of liability of the Copyright Owner is limited to the amount of the compensation that
              the User paid for one Full License.
              <br />
              The limitations of liability of the Copyright Owner that are specified in this section
              of the Agreement apply to the Program and all associated objects.

              together with the appropriate Additional Licenses are also terminated immediately
              after the User violates any part of this Agreement without any additional notice from

              If any condition of this Agreement for any reason becomes unenforceable, or is voided
              or declared invalid by the competent court, then it is regarded as an omission from
              the text of this Agreement, which, however, shall by no means affect the legitimacy
              and validity of the other conditions.
              <br />

              The User acknowledges that the Copyright Owner may suffer damage if the conditions of
              this Agreement are not respected, and therefore the User agrees that the Copyright
              Owner has the right to use any form of protecting the violated rights and legitimate
              interests, including the direct appeal to the appropriate court without a necessity to
              comply with the claim settlement procedure.
            </p>

            <p>
              The governing law of the Agreement shall be the substantive law of Russian Federation.

              the subject of dispute may be only suspension of recovery on the basis of the enforced
              document questioned by the plaintiff or any other document under which penalties are
              recovered on non-acceptable basis. The plaintiff shall bear its own and the other
              Party's costs associated with the resolution or arbitration of any dispute, and all
